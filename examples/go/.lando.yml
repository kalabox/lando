# Go server example
name: go

# Give me http://go.lndo.site and https://go.lndo.site
proxy:
  appserver:
    - go.lndo.site

# Spin up services to run a basic go server
services:

  # Create a go instance
  appserver:

    # go version 1.8
    type: go:1.8

    # Optionally create certs in /certs that can be used by your application
    # to listen over https. Creates the following certs your app can use
    #
    #   - /certs/cert.key
    #   - /certs/cert.crt
    #   - /certs/cert.pem
    #
    # ssl: true

    # Optionally specify a command to run when you start your go service up.
    #
    # If you are using go as a server you are going to want to define this.
    # This can be either a string or array.
    #
    # If you are just spinning up a go container to run cli things
    # you can leave this blank and the container will boot up and stay on
    #
    command: go run /app/http1.go

    # Install some extra server packages
    # run_as_root:
    #  - "apt-get update -y"
    #  - "apt-get install vim -y"

    # Print a message just to demonstrate this
    # run:
    # - "cd $LANDO_MOUNT & echo 'Holla!'"

# Add some nice command routing
tooling:

  # Any go service with a defined command (aka not running in cli only mode)
  # Will also spin up a go cli container called `SERVICENAME_cli` (appserver_cli)
  # in this example.
  #
  # This will allow you to run things like `lando npm install` without needing
  # to `lando start` first. This is particularly needed for go based projects
  # since you almost always need to run `npm install` before you can boot up your
  # app successfully.
  go:
    service: appserver_cli
