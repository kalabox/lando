  # Create a node server

    command: npm start

      - npm install

  # Spin up a solr container called "index"
  # NOTE: "index" is arbitrary, you could just as well call this "tswift" or "covfefe"
  index:

    # Use solr version 5.5
    type: solr:5.5

    # Optionally allow access to the database at localhost:9999
    # You will need to make sure port 9999 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 9999

    # Optionally declare the name of the solr core.
    # This setting is only applicable for versions 5.5 and above
    core: freedom

    # Optionally use custom solr config files eg (schema.xml and solrconfig.xml)
    # This is helpful if frameworks require custom config eg Drupal.
    # This is relative to the app root (which may be different from your webroot).
    # This should be the directory containing the schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files, not the path to a certain file.
    #config:
    #  conf: solrconf
