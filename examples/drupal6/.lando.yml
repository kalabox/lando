  # See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements

  # php: '7.0'

  # Optionally specify whether you want to serve drupal via nginx or apache
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest apache
  # via: nginx

  # Optionally specify the location of the webroot relative to your approot.

  # If ommitted this will be your approot itself.
  # webroot: web

  # Optionally specify the version of drush you want for your site
  #

  # Optionally specify the database type, this can be one of:
  #
  #   - `mysql`
  #   - `mariadb`
  #   - `postgres`
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest mysql. You can additionally provide
  # a version with `type:version` but you will need to consult the documentation
  # for the correct DB service to see what versions are available
  # database: mariadb:10.1

  # Optionally mix in your own config files
  #
  # If ommitted this will use the default drupal config files for the respective
  # services. Definitely consult the relevant documentaion for each service to
  # make sure you are specifying the correct value for the config. As an example
  # `mysql` will want a directory while `postgres` will want a specific config file.
