# Start with the default WordPress recipe
recipe: wordpress

# Configure the WordPress recipe
config:

  # See: https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/

  # Optionally specify the php version to use.
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest php version supported by WordPress.
  # Consult the `php` service to see what versions are available. Note that all
  # such versions may not be supported in WordPress so YMMV.
  #
  # See: https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/
  #
  # NOTE: that this needs to be wrapped in quotes so that it is a string
  #
  php: '7.0'

  # Optionally specify whether you want to serve drupal via nginx or apache
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest apache
  #
  # See: https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/
  #
  via: nginx

  # Optionally specify the location of the webroot relative to your approot.
  #
  # If ommitted this will be your approot itself.
  #
  webroot: web

  # Optionally specify the database type, this can be one of:
  #
  #   - `mysql`
  #   - `mariadb`
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest mysql. You can additionally provide
  # a version with `type:version` but you will need to consult the documentation
  # for the correct DB service to see what versions are available
  #
  # see: https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/
  #
  database: mariadb

  # Optionally mix in your own config files
  #
  # If ommitted this will use the default WordPress config files for the respective
  # services.
  #
  # Definitely consult the relevant documentaion for each service to make sure
  # you are specifying the correct value for the config.

# The WordPress recipe is super slick but we want to augment this recipe so we can
# run our front end tooling magix and use a key value store
