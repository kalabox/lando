# Python app
name: python

# Give me http://python.lndo.site and https://python.lndo.site
proxy:
  appserver:
    - python.lndo.site

# Spin up services to run a basic python server
services:

  # Create a python instance
  appserver:

    # Python version 3.6
    type: python:3.6

    # Optionally create certs in /certs that can be used by your application
    # to listen over https. Creates the following certs your app can use
    #
    #   - /certs/cert.key
    #   - /certs/cert.crt
    #   - /certs/cert.pem
    #
    # ssl: true

    # Optionally specify a command/script to run when you start your python service up.
    #
    # If you are using python as a server you are going to want to define this.
    # This can be either a string or array.
    #
    # If you are just spinning up a python container for usage as a cli tool
    # you can leave this blank and the container will boot up and stay on
    #
    # You will likely want to run needed build steps eg `lando pip install`
    # first so needed dependencies are installed before your server starts up.
    #
    command: python /app/server.py

    # Install some extra server packages
    # run_as_root:
    #  - "apt-get update -y"
    #  - "apt-get install vim -y"

    # Print a message just to demonstrate this
    # run:
    # - "cd $LANDO_MOUNT & echo 'Holla!'"

# Add some nice command routing
tooling:

  # Any python service with a defined command (aka not running in cli only mode)
  # Will also spin up a python cli container called `SERVICENAME_cli` (appserver_cli)
  # in this example.
  #
  # This will allow you to run things like `lando pip install` without needing
  # to `lando start` first. This is particularly needed for python based projects
  # since you almost always need to run `pip install` before you can boot up your
  # app successfully.
