# Drupal7 recipe
name: d7

# Start with the default Drupal7 recipe
recipe: drupal7

# Configure the Drupal7 recipe
config:

  # See: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements

  # Optionally specify the php version to use.
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest php version supported by Drupal 7.
  # Consult the `php` service to see what version are available
  #
  # NOTE: that this needs to be wrapped in quotes so that it is a string
  php: '7.0'

  # Optionally specify whether you want to serve drupal via nginx or apache
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest apache
  via: nginx

  # Optionally specify the location of the webroot relative to your approot.
  #
  # If ommitted this will be your approot itself.
  webroot: web

  # Optionally specify the version of drush you want for your site
  #
  # If ommitted this will use the stable drush 8
  drush: 7

  # Optionally specify the database type, this can be one of:
  #
  #   - `mysql`
  #   - `mariadb`
  #   - `postgres`
  #
  # If ommitted this will default to the latest mysql. You can additionally provide
  # a version with `type:version` but you will need to consult the documentation
  # for the correct DB service to see what versions are available
  database: mariadb:10.1

  # Optionally mix in your own config files
  #
  # If ommitted this will use the default drupal config files for the respective
  # services. Definitely consult the relevant documentaion for each service to
  # make sure you are specifying the correct value for the config. As an example
  # `mysql` will want a directory while `postgres` will want a specific config file.
  # conf:
    # server: config/drupal7.conf
    # database: config/mysql
    # php: config/php.ini

# The Drupal 7 recipe is super slick but we want to augment this recipe so we can
# run our front end tooling magix and use a key value store
