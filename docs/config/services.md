Services
========

Lando provides a way to easily specify the services and tooling your app needs via `.lando.yml`. You can use services to replace the loading of Docker compose files, although you can use both.

> #### Info::Docker compose files are loaded first
>
> If you want to load Docker compose files **and** use services you should note that compose files are loaded first. This means that depending on how you name things your services could override things set in your compose files.

Supported Services
------------------

The following services are currently supported. Please check out each one to learn how to use them.

  * ####[apache](./../services/apache.md)
  * ####[mariadb](./../services/mariadb.md)
  * ####[mysql](./../services/mysql.md)
  * ####[nginx](./../services/nginx.md)
  * ####[php](./../services/php.md)
  * ####[postgres](./../services/postgres.md)

Environment
-----------

While you can add additional environmental variables on a per service basis (see [Advanced Service Configuration](#advanced-service-configuration) below) Lando will inject some common and helpful environmental variables into each service.

```bash
LANDO=ON
LANDO_SERVICE_TYPE=nginx
LANDO_HOST_UID=501
LANDO_HOST_GID=20
LANDO_SERVICE_NAME=appserver
LANDO_HOST_OS=darwin
```

Shared Files
------------

While you can also share in additional files and directories via our [sharing plugin](./sharing.md) or with docker volumes (see [Advanced Service Configuration](#advanced-service-configuration) below) we share a few useful host directories into each service.

| Host Location | Container Location |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `/path/to/my/app` | `/app` |
| `$HOME` | `/user` |

Build Extras
------------

If you do not want to use your own custom image or Dockerfile via [Advanced Service Configuration](#advanced-service-configuration) we let you run some extra build steps after each service is started. Note that these steps must make sense within the context of the container you are running eg you will not be able to run `dnf` inside of a `debian` flavored container.

This is useful for adding in some additional dev tools you might prefer like `vim` or for adding in things like extra php extensions not installed by default.

```yml
services:
  appserver:
    type: php:7.1
    extras:
      - apt-get update -y
      - apt-get install vim
```

Advanced Service Configuration
------------------------------

Our services layer is an abstraction on top of the [Docker compose v3 file format](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/). Specifically, Lando will translate the configuration you specify for each service into relevant docker compose files and execute them at runtime. This gives you a lot of power to hypertune your services at the docker compose level. You can pass docker compose config into each service using the `overrides` key.

Here is an example of an overriden apache service that uses a custom image and injects some additional envvars.

```yml
services:
  html:
    type: apache:custom
    overrides:
      services:
        environment:
          STUFF: THINGS
          THINGS: GUYS
        image: pirog/myapache:2
```
