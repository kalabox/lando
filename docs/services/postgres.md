> #### Warning::Be Careful Switching Database Type or Version
>
> You should be careful switching database types or versions as the underlying database files between these things may not be compatible. **Ignoring this warning can cause your database service to not start correctly!!!**

> You can read more about this [here](./../issues/switching-dbs.md)

Example
-------

{% codesnippet "./../examples/postgres/.lando.yml" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

You will need to rebuild your app with `lando rebuild` to apply the changes to this file. You can check out the full code for this example [over here](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/examples/postgres).

Getting information
-------------------

You can get connection and credential information about your database by running `lando info` from inside your app.

```bash
# Navigate to the app
cd /path/to/app

# Get info (app needs to be running to get this)
lando info
