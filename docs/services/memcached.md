Memcached
=========

[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering. You can easily add it to your Lando app by adding an entry to the `services` key in your app's `.lando.yml`.

Supported versions
------------------

*   **[1.5](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/memcached/)** **(default)**
*   [1.4](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/memcached/)
*   custom

Using patch versions
--------------------

While Lando does not "officially" support specifying a patch version of this service you can try specifying one using [overrides](https://docs.devwithlando.io/config/advanced.html#overriding-with-docker-compose) if you need to. **This is not guaranteed to work** so use at your own risk and take some care to make sure you are using a `debian` flavored patch version that also matches up with the `major` and `minor` versions of the service that we indicate above in "Supported versions".

[Here](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/memcached/tags/) are all the tags that are available for this service.

Example
-------

{% codesnippet "./../examples/memcached/.lando.yml" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

You will need to rebuild your app with `lando rebuild` to apply the changes to this file. You can check out the full code for this example [over here](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/examples/memcached).

Getting information
-------------------

You can get connection and credential information about your memcached instance by running `lando info` from inside your app.

```bash
# Navigate to the app
cd /path/to/app

# Get info (app needs to be running to get this)
lando info
