Using Lando with VS Code
========================

[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/) is a great open source editor for programming.
It is however not so easy to debug PHP applications - especially when they're run inside Docker containers, like Lando.

This is a basic setup to help you in this task.

Getting Started
---------------

Enable XDebug by adding some lines to your Lando recipe.

```yaml
# Enable XDebug in your .lando.yml
name: mywebsite
recipe: drupal8
config:
  webroot: docroot
  xdebug: true
  conf:
    # Tell Lando to use additional PHP settings.
    # The location of this file is arbitrary.
    # We placed it inside .vscode/ folder simply because we find it convenient.
    php: .vscode/php.ini
```

Create the custom `php.ini` file to add XDebug settings to PHP.

```bash
touch .vscode/php.ini
code .vscode/php.ini
```

Add your custom XDebug settings.

```ini
[PHP]

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;IMPORTANT;
;PLACE THIS FILE UNDER .vscode folder;
;SO IT DOESNT GET COMMITTED;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Xdebug
xdebug.max_nesting_level = 256
xdebug.show_exception_trace = 0
xdebug.collect_params = 0
# Extra custom Xdebug setting for debug to work in VSCode.
xdebug.remote_enable = 1
xdebug.remote_autostart = 1
```

Rebuild your environment.

```bash
lando rebuild
```

Finally, you need a custom `launch.json` file in VS Code in order to map paths so that XDebug works correctly.

```bash
touch .vscode/launch.json
code .vscode/launch.json
```

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "XDebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9000,
      "log": true,
      // We used to do this in previous versions of VS Code:
      // "localSourceRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/",
      // "serverSourceRoot": "/app/",
      //
      // But this has been deprecated and we now use this:
      "pathMappings": {
        "/app/": "${workspaceFolder}/",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Done!

You can now click start debugging (type F5 or click on the icon in the left sidebar).

Debugging PhpUnit
-----------------

Debugging PhpUnit tests in VS Code requires a little more setup, but Lando helps to make it easier.

First, you need to have VS code listen for debugging on 2 separate ports, because PhpUnit runs in one process and the tests themselves in another, and VS Code's Xdebug extension currently struggles with this. You accomplish this by have a launch.json that looks like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Normal",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9000,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/app/": "${workspaceFolder}/",
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "PhpUnit dummy",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9001,
    }
  ],
  "compounds": [
    {
        "name": "PhpUnit",
        "configurations": ["Normal", "PhpUnit dummy"]
    }
       ]
}
```

Next add some custom tooling to your .lando.yml file, that provides a command to run PhpUnit in a way points the main PhpUnit process to the PhpUnit dummy debugger we just added. (The syntax here assumes a project-specific installation of PhpUnit, not a global one).

```yml
tooling:
  phpunitdebug:
    service: appserver
    cmd:
      - "php"
      - "-d"
      - "xdebug.remote_port=9001"
      - "vendor/bin/phpunit"
```

Now to run debug a PhpUnit test, do the following:

1. Select the compound "PhpUnit" as your debugger in VS Code's UI, and start it.
2. Make sure you untick "Everything" in the breakpoints section of the UI, or it will break everytime PhpUnit throws an exception, even if it's properly caught by PhpUnit.
3. Add a breakpoint in your code that is being tested.
4. On your command line run PhpUnit with something like `lando phpunitdebug --filter=testMyTestMethodName` (this example is of running a single test method, actually you can add any phpunit options you like at the end).
