# Getting Started

The Lando revolution relies upon new converts. You've probably already told some of your co-workers and friends to try Lando. Maybe you've [written some guides](./guides-intro.md) and [sponsored Lando yourself](./sponsor-intro.md). What's the next step?

## Becoming an Upseller

Upsellers essentially help connect us with people and/or orgs who might either sponsor Lando or purchase development related services from Lando or its parent company [Tandem](https://thinktandem.io). In the case of the latter we kick back a percentage of the profits from the engagement as our own "internal sponsorship".

To become an upseller...

1. [Register for the Lando Alliance](https://lando.dev/alliance/join), making sure to check the box next to "Upseller".
2. [Fill out the Lando contact form](https://lando.dev/contact/), telling us about the organization you think should sponsor Lando.

Our "sales" team will get in touch with you right away to set up a meeting to talk next steps.

## Why Ask Your Organization to Sponsor Lando?

If you and your team are saving development time using Lando, your organization is already receiving dividends from the bank of Lando. Instead of each developer on your team paying part of their paycheck to sponsor, shouldn't your organization invest back to make sure the Lando royalties keep getting dished out?

Asking your boss to sponsor Lando might seem tough. Why should they pay for something they're already getting for free? There are _many_ reasons and we've prepared them all in the easily distributable blog content below
