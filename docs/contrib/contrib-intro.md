# Getting Started

::: danger NOT READY YET!
We are still working on the Lando Alliance contributor program so this content _may_ be out of date. We are planning to launch on May 4, 2020.

In the meantime we recommend you get on the waitlist by [joining The Alliance](https://lando.dev/alliance/join/) as a contributor.
:::

This section is designed for people who want to contrib `code things` to Lando. Specifically that might mean working on

* Lando itself and its plugins
* Lando's DevOps pipeline eg build, test and deploy
* Lando's tests and testing infrastructure
* Lando's documentation and Vuepress documentation site
* Lando's express API
* Lando's marketing website
* Lando's metrics server
* Lando's Vuepress marketing site
* Lando's Vuepress events listing
* Lando's Vuepress blog

## What do I need to get started?

You will need to go through all the steps in our [Getting Involved](contributing) section if you have not done so already. This will get you rolling for contribution. Here are all the steps from the aforementioned section for completeness.

1. [Join the alliance](./join.md) as a contributor
2. [Join the comms](./comms.md)
3. [Install Lando from source and activate secret toggle](./activate.md)
4. [Add yourself as a contributor](./first.md)

If you are having issues with any of the above or need some guidance from one of our guide pros make sure you [join our Slack org](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and check out the **#community** and/or **#contributors** channels.
