# Onboarding

The admin will likely need some mix of the following things to assist. These are expressed vaguely for security purposes where appropriate.

* A `lando.dev` email account
* Access to the Lando admin and/or sponsorships email accounts
* Access to Lando's sponsorship platforms
* Access to Lando's marketing tools
* Access to Lando's twitter management platform
* Access to Lando's CRM
* Access to Lando's [GitHub org and repos](https://github.com/lando)
* Access to Lando's [Slack org](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando)
* Invitation to any relevant internal documents or assets
* Invitation to any relevant internal meetings
* **Invitation to private Slack admin channel**

## Offboarding

Unsurprisingly, offboarding should result in removal of access to all of the above.
