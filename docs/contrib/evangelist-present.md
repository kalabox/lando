# Presenting

The most obvious and straightforward way to evangelize is to present about Lando or Lando-adjacent things at a meetup, camp, conference, training or other gathering.

Here are some helpful steps to get you started.

## Finding an event

We recommend getting in touch with local event organizers to help you get started. It's also a good idea to [join our Slack org](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and check out the **#community** and/or **#evangelists** channels. There is likely another Lando evangelist who can help you out.

Here are some well known places to get you started.

* [Drupal Event Calendar](https://www.drupical.com)
* [WordPress Event Calendar](https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/)
* [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)


## Submitting a session, proposal or deck

Once you've found an event the next step is usually to submit a session/proposal and/or start creating the content for your presentation, talk or training.

While you certainly can create content from scratch we recommend you request access to this [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ooK_NTMBuwOV0uix8O54umJGwAODL9dC) as it contains a large cache of previously submitted sessions, proposals, slidedecks and training materials. It's highly likely you can fork or adapt some of this shit as a starting point.

We also highly encourage you to contribute your finished presentation materials back to the same Google folder. This both aids future evangelists and also serves as a record for posterity.

Before crafting your content definitely check out the [talking points](./talking-points) and [selling points](./upseller-intro) docs.
