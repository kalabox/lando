Some notes about the structure:

* Code that is easily unit testable and does not require the `lando` object should live in `lib`.
* Code that requires the `lando` object should be expressed in `plugins`.
* Code that extends the core `lando` object will *almost always* be in `plugins` and not `lib`.
