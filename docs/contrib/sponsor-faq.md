# FAQ

Here are some answers to some of our most frequent questions about sponsorship.

## When will I show up on the website, twitter etc?

We usually batch update our [list of sponsors](https://lando.dev/sponsor/) and twitter queue _at least_ once a week so you should expect to see yourself or your org on the website within a week. Twitter can be a different story and depends on the queue. If there are a lot of sponsors in front of you you might have to wait up to a month to get your shout out.

An exception to the above rule is if you have sponsored at one of our higher tiers and we've provided custom marketing benefits. However, in this case you will directly in touch with one of our team to coordinate the rollout.

If you feel like the above has not happened correctly and something is wrong please reach out to us at <sponsorships@lando.dev> so we can make it right.

## When can I expect my swag?

Due to the time and administrative overhead we usually send swag out once a quarter. So, if it's been three months or more reach out to us at <sponsorships@lando.dev> so we can make it right.

## I want to sponsor, but can I get different benefits?

Yes!

Our highest two tiers are fairly customizable based around your needs. If you would like to put together custom sponsorship terms then [contact us](https://lando.dev/contact/) and let us know what you are looking for. Our team will get in touch with you shortly and try to figure out something that works for all.

## How do I cancel a sponsorship?

We rely on third party sponsorship platforms to manage your sponsorship so you will want to terminate your sponsorship with them! For convenience here are the relevant docs on how to do so for each of the platforms we support.
