# Benefits

Within a few days of pledging your sponsorship on one of the above platforms you should receive an email with instructions on how to claim your sponsor benefits. If you don't get that email, let us know by emailing <sponsorships@lando.dev>.

Benefits start at the "Herald" level (currently the $9/month individual sponsor level) and include...

* Lando Alliance t-shirt (and future swag benefits)
* "Thank you" mention on the Lando website and docs
* Shout out on Twitter

"Ally" team-level sponsors also get...

* Your team's logo featured as a sponsor
* Participation in product roadmap survey

"Partner" and "Patriot" level sponsorships are intended for organizations with large teams or products that integrate with Lando. These sponsors receive access to the Lando team, support, and other benefits depending on commitment level.

If you know an organization that needs a local development solution, let us know by becoming an [upseller](./upseller-intro.md).

For the official list of benefits check out our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lando) page.
