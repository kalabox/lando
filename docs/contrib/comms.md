# 3. Join the Comms

Once you've joined [The Lando Alliance](https://lando.dev/join) we recommend you start collaborating with other contributors. This primarily happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues) and [Slack](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando).

Additional you can [follow us](https://twitter.com/devwithlando) on the hellscape that is Twitter to help expand our reach.

## GitHub

GitHub serves as the mechanism for all Lando code, issue reporting/tracking and project management.

While the [Lando Organization](https://github.com/lando) serves as the starting point for all Lando projects, most collaboration is going to occur in the core [Lando Project](https://github.com/lando/lando) and its [issue queue](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues).

It you are a contributor it is **highly recommended** you also install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) to get access to a nice Kanban style board for the GitHub issues.

## Slack

Slack serves as the mechanism for Lando support and contributor coordination. You can join the Lando slack org via [LaunchPass](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando). By default you will be added to the **#community** channel which is our free and open community support channel. You also should join any of the additional channels below as is appropriate:

  * **#administrators** - For those who help administer and coordinate Lando
  * **#alliance** - For all Lando Alliance members
  * **#bloggers** - For those contributing case studies, training materials and other content to the blog
  * **#evangelists** - For those looking to evangelize Lando at meetups, events, camps, etc
  * **#guiders** - For those writing helpful Lando guides and tutorials
  * **#upsellers** - For those helping to help sell Lando sponsorships, support and services
  * **#contributors** - For those who contribute to the making of Lando
