# 5. Make First Contribution

Now that you are all setup it's time to make your first contribution. Follow the sections below to add yourself to the [team](./team.html) and learn our workflow.

## Recommended workflow

### Create a new branch

Lando uses a modified [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) development model. You can read more about this process in the aforementioned link but the general codeflow is:

```bash
# Make sure you are in the lando source repo
cd /path/to/cloned/lando/source

# Make sure you are on an updated maser
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Checkout a new branch for your contribution
git checkout -b addContribMe
```

### Add yourself as a contributor

```bash
# Follow and answer the interactive prompts
lando.dev contrib:add

# Verify you've been added
lando.dev contrib:list
```

### Commit and push

```bash
# Add updates, commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Adding MYSELF to the team"
git push origin addContribMe
```

### Open a Pull Request

[Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Manual workflow

If the recommended workflow above is not working for you then you still have a few options. **We definitely don't prefer these since they require work on our end.**

### Directly edit

Try editing the [contributor database](https://github.com/lando/lando/blob/master/api/data/contributors.yml) directly. If you are not sure how to do that then consult [these docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).

You will want to add an entry like this:

```yaml

    - Outreach

  id: 0374ef006c170c19a0fddcf006415d548058e1f7
```

### Submit an issue
