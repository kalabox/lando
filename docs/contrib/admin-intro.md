# Getting Started

Administrators are a _very special_ contributor role geared towards the thankless but extremeley necessary work of both keeping the Alliance rolling and our sponsors satisfied.

In order to do the above you will likely need access to some of Lando's backend systems. This means this role is built on trust and not everyone will be immediately eligible for all parts of it.

## What do I need to get started?

Getting the ball rolling is a one-step process:

1. [Join the alliance as an administrator](./join.md)

You'll get an email from our current admins so we can set up an initial interview!
