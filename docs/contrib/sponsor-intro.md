# Getting Started

Sponsorship is the easiest and often-most-helpful-to-us way to contribue; just register directly with one of the supported sponsorship platforms below or [join The Lando Alliance](https://lando.dev/alliance/join/) and start helping Lando!

## How to Sponsor

While you can sponsor directly using any of the below platforms we recommend you [join The Lando Alliance](https://lando.dev/alliance/join/) and sponsor through the mechanisms presented there. This way we can better engage with you in the future.

GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, and Open Collective: all three of these official Lando sponsorship methods are valid, but each comes with its own transaction fees and caveats. Broadly speaking, we've adjusted the sponsorship amount to account for transaction fees.

### [With GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lando) (**preferred**)

[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lando) is the best way to sponsor Lando for the following reasons:

**Lowest Sponsorship Amount**: GitHub Sponsors doesn't charge a transaction fee right now, so all your sponsorship $$$ helps Lando!
**2X Matching**: GitHub Sponsors will match all sponsorship dollars up to $5,000 in the first year. Your cash goes further!

### [With Patreon](https://patreon.com/devwithlando)

The gold standard of sponsoring creatives, [Patreon](https://patreon.com/devwithlando) does charge a transactional fee, hence why you'll see sponsorship rates are a little higher there. Rest assured that Lando gets the same amount, but all things being equal you might want to use GitHub Sponsors instead.

### [With Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/lando)

[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/lando) has similar drawbacks to Patreon, _however_, it may allow us to redistribute funds to projects Lando relies upon and other contributors in the future. If you're a devotee to the Open Collective ethos, give here, otherwise, GitHub Sponsors!
