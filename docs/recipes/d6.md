Drupal 6
========

[Drupal 6](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.0) is an open source platform and content management system for building amazing digital experiences. It's made by a dedicated community. Anyone can use it, and it will always be free.

You can easily boot up a best practices stack to run Drupal 6  by adding the following to your app's `.lando.yml`.

```yml
name: myapp
recipe: drupal6
```

You can easily configure/override the Drupal 6 recipe and add in additional `.lando.yml` config such as `services`, `tooling`, `proxy setting` and `sharing`.

### Example

{% codesnippet "./../examples/drupal6/.lando.yml" %}{% endcodesnippet %}

You will need to restart your app with `lando restart` for changes to this file to take. You can check out the full code for this example [over here.](https://github.com/kalabox/lando/tree/master/examples/drupal7-2)

### Installing Drupal

You will need to make sure you [extract Drupal 6](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/INSTALL.txt/6.x) into either your application root directory or the subdirectory specified by `webroot` in your recipe config.

You will also want to scope out your database credentials (see [below](#getting-service-information)) so you can be prepped to enter them during the drupal installation. You will want to use `internal_connection` information.

If you want to see an example you can use the [example above](https://github.com/kalabox/lando/tree/master/examples/drupal6) to get started.

```bash
# Get the lando example
git clone https://github.com/kalabox/lando.git
cd lando/examples/drupal6

# Start the app up
lando start

# Get your database credentials
lando info

# Visit https://d6.lndo.site to complete your installation.

# Check the status of your site with drush
lando drush status
```

### Getting Service Information

You can get more in depth information about the services this recipe provides by running `lando info`

```bash
# Navigate to the app
cd /path/to/app

# Get info (app needs to be running to get this)
