Running Lando behind a network PROXY or FIREWALL
------------------------------------------------

If you are pulling container images and seeing errors like "Error while pulling image: Get https://index.docker.io/v1/repositories/kalabox/proxy/images: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" in your macOS/Linux installer log then you might be behind a network proxy or firewall that is preventing you from pulling the needed Kalabox dependencies.

Check out [https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/issues/1635](https://github.com/kalabox/kalabox/issues/1635) for more details on that issue.
