**THIS RELEASE CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT CODE REFACTORING TO HELP WITH TESTING. YOU MAY WANT TO HOLD OFF FOR A FEW VERSIONS IF YOU WANT TO BE SUPER SAFE ABOUT THINGS!**

**BUT IF YOU"RE AWESOME AND WANT TO HELP US, USE IT AND BREAK IT AND SUBMIT ISSUES.** If you do experience any issues try the following corrective action first:

  1. `lando rebuild` any failing apps
  2. `lando destroy` and then `lando start` any failing apps
  3. Restart the docker daemon
  4. Restart your computer
  5. `docker rm -f CONTAINER_ID` any containers throwing errors
  6. Reset the docker daemon to factory defaults (this will blow up all your containers)
  7. Submit an issue to GitHub
  8. Revert to [beta.35](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.35) :(
