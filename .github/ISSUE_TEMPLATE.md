Bug Report
==========

The **FASTEST** way for us to verify and resolve your bug if for you to [write a functional test that breaks](https://docs.devwithlando.io/dev/testing.html#functional-tests) and submit it as a pull request.

If you are not sure how to do that then please complete as much of the below section as possible

**Tell us about your setup**

What is your lando version and operating system? **(note that the older your version the less likely we are to reply)**

*Example: v3.0.0-alpha1 on Windows 10 Professional*

**Tell us about your `.lando.yml`**

Paste in the contents of your `.lando.yml` this is **SUPER HELPFUL** for us.

*Example:*

```yml
name: lamp2
recipe: lamp
config:
  php: '5.6'
  webroot: www
  database: mysql
  xdebug: true
  conf:
    server: config/lamp.conf
    database: config/mysql
    php: config/php.ini
```

It is also helpful to include other relevant config files. For example, include `pantheon.yml` for a `pantheon` recipe if applicable. Include `php.ini` or `mysql.cnf` if you are overriding our defualt config.

**Tell us about the command you were running**

Paste in a series of commands that caused the bug.

*Example:*

```bash
lando init mysite --recipe lamp --webroot web
lando start
# Edited my lando.yml as above
lando rebuild -y
```

**Tell us about the error you got**

Rerun the command that produced your error in `verbose` mode. Note that `verbose` mode is run like this `lando command -- -vvv`. Paste in the error and the ~100 lines that proceeded it.

*Example:*

```bash
lando CMDTHATFAILED -- -vvvv
```

**Tell us generally about your bug**

*Example: I tried to create a pantheon site but got a `LowerCase` not defined exception*

Please detail the steps we can take to replicate this bug. Be as detailed as possible.

*Example:*

```bash
1. Started up GUI
2. Clicked on my Pantheon account in the sidebar
3. Selected a site and an environment
4. Kept the default create options and pressed submit
```

**Tell us more**

Could better documentation have prevented this issue? if so what should we change?
Does this bug prevent you from using lando?

Feature Request
===============

Please explain your request and its importance in the form of a user story.

*Example: As a lando user who works with Drupal sites that have large databases, I want the option to exclude unnecessary database tables from being pulled when I update my site because I want faster "site pull" actions.*

Please provide some detail on how lando can help solve this problem

*Example: Place an option on the "site pull" screen to exclude cache tables.*
